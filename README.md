I don't like to argue with the designer all the time just for everything.
So I am trying to learn some UI/UX design but I am still a programmer and I am so lazy to learn a UI interface to generate assets.
So I wrote this playground for myself to do icons etc. easly.
It is a copy left project be free to distribute and adjust

## ToDo
 - [ - ] Add layout guideline
 - [ - ] Add nodes to not fuck around positions when using path
 - [ - ] And make path d string generation easier cuz it's to snake maze
