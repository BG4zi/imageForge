# imageForge

I don't like to argue with the designer all the time just for everything.
So I am trying to learn some UI/UX design but I am still a programmer and I am so lazy to learn a UI interface to generate assets.
So I wrote this playground for myself to do icons etc. easly.
It is a copy left project be free to distribute and adjust

## Usage
I didn't build the vite app so untill I'll just clone the repo and run it as dev mode

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/BG4zi/imageForge.git
$ cd imageForge
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

and on `` public/forge  `` directory with js extension you can do your coding on the file that u can make. and when u go on ur browser to the path SERVERURL/?file=/forge/file.js it does render it for u with hot reload and all

## ToDo
 - [ - ] Add layout guideline
 - [ - ] Add nodes to not fuck around positions when using path
 - [ - ] And make path d string generation easier cuz it's to snake maze
